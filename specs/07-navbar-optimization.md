# Navbar Optimization: Compact Design Implementation

## Overview
Transform the current oversized navigation bar into a sleek, compact design that matches modern UI standards as shown in the reference design.

## Current State Analysis
**Issues with Current Navbar:**
- Icons too large (20px, should be ~12-14px)
- Container too wide and tall
- Excessive padding (2px-3px, should be ~1-2px)
- Gap between icons too large (1px, should be 0px)
- Overall appearance bulky and prominent
- Border radius too large for compact design

## Target Design Requirements

### Visual Specifications
- **Container**: Ultra-compact pill shape
- **Icon Size**: 12-14px (currently 20px)
- **Container Padding**: 1-2px vertical, 2-3px horizontal
- **Icon Spacing**: 0px gap between icons
- **Border Radius**: 8-10px (currently 12px)
- **Background**: More subtle/transparent
- **Overall Width**: ~120-140px total (currently ~160px+)

### Reference Design Characteristics
1. **Minimal footprint**: Barely noticeable at top of screen
2. **Tight icon spacing**: Icons nearly touching each other
3. **Subtle appearance**: Blends into background
4. **Compact height**: Very low profile
5. **Consistent purple accent**: Active state clearly visible

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Size Reduction (High Priority)
- [ ] Reduce icon container size from 20px to 14px
- [ ] Decrease font size from 10px to 8px
- [ ] Minimize container padding to 1px vertical, 2px horizontal
- [ ] Remove gaps between icons (gap: 0px)
- [ ] Reduce border radius to 8px

### Phase 2: Visual Refinement (High Priority)
- [ ] Adjust background opacity for subtlety
- [ ] Fine-tune border color and opacity
- [ ] Optimize shadow for minimal visual weight
- [ ] Ensure purple active state remains visible

### Phase 3: Responsive Optimization (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Mobile: Reduce to 12px icons
- [ ] Mobile: 1px padding all around
- [ ] Mobile: 6px border radius
- [ ] Ensure touch targets remain accessible

### Phase 4: Polish (Low Priority)
- [ ] Smooth transitions between states
- [ ] Optimize tooltip positioning for compact size
- [ ] Test across different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify accessibility standards

## Technical Specifications

### CSS Changes Required
```css
.mini-dock-nav {
  padding: 1px 2px;          /* Was: 2px 3px */
  gap: 0px;                  /* Was: 1px */

  height: 14px;              /* Was: 20px */
  font-size: 8px;            /* Was: 10px */
  border-radius: 3px;        /* Was: 4px */
}

/* Mobile */
.mini-nav-icon {
