# Phase 5: Deployment Readiness (High Priority)

## 5.1 Build Optimization

### Technical Configuration
- **Target**: GitHub Pages
- **URL**: http://DanielEskinazi.github.io
- **Branch Strategy**: Deploy from `main` branch
- **Build Command**: `yarn build`
- **Deploy Command**: `yarn deploy`

### Tasks
- [ ] Verify production build success
- [ ] Test deployment process locally
- [ ] Validate GitHub Pages configuration
- [ ] Check homepage URL in package.json
- [ ] Ensure all assets load correctly from subdirectory

### Build Validation
- [ ] `yarn build` completes without errors
- [ ] All components render in production build
- [ ] Static assets (CSS, JS) generated correctly
- [ ] No broken imports or missing dependencies

## 5.2 Final Validation

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All sections functional and complete
- [ ] Contact form working with Formspree
- [ ] Navigation smooth scrolling operational
- [ ] Mobile responsive across devices
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility standards achieved

### Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Site loads correctly at GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] All internal links work
- [ ] Contact form submits successfully
- [ ] Particle effects render properly
- [ ] Mobile experience optimized
- [ ] No console errors in production

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- **Particle effects performance on mobile**: Test thoroughly, implement fallbacks
- **Formspree form submission reliability**: Verify API key and configuration
- **GitHub Pages deployment configuration**: Double-check homepage and deploy settings

### Deployment Strategy
1. Test build locally first
2. Deploy to staging branch (if available)
3. Validate staging deployment
4. Deploy to production (main branch)
5. Monitor for issues post-deployment
