# Interactive Mouse-Tracking Effects

This directory contains implementation plans for four different mouse-tracking interactive effects for the portfolio hero section.

## Effect Options

### 1. Eye-Tracking Effect (`eye-tracking-effect` branch)
**Concept**: Profile photo with eyes that follow the mouse cursor
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Timeline**: 10-15 hours
- **Best For**: Personal, engaging interaction
- **Tech Stack**: React hooks, CSS transforms, image overlays

### 2. 3D Tilt Effect (`3d-tilt-effect` branch)
**Concept**: Card-like 3D tilt that follows mouse movement with depth
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Timeline**: 11-16 hours
- **Best For**: Modern, professional feel
- **Tech Stack**: CSS 3D transforms, perspective, dynamic lighting

### 3. Dynamic Lighting Effect (`lighting-effect` branch)
**Concept**: Realistic lighting and shadows that change with cursor position
- **Complexity**: High
- **Timeline**: 14-19 hours
- **Best For**: Artistic, sophisticated presentation
- **Tech Stack**: CSS gradients, blend modes, optional Canvas/WebGL

### 4. Parallax Layers Effect (`parallax-layers-effect` branch)
**Concept**: Multi-layer depth with different movement speeds
- **Complexity**: High
- **Timeline**: 16-22 hours
- **Best For**: Immersive, storytelling experience
- **Tech Stack**: 3D transforms, layer management, physics

## Implementation Strategy

### Branch Structure
Each effect has its own dedicated branch for development:
```
latest (current)
├── eye-tracking-effect
├── 3d-tilt-effect  
├── lighting-effect
└── parallax-layers-effect
```

### Selection Criteria

#### Choose **Eye-Tracking** if you want:
- Personal, memorable interaction
- Moderate development time
- Broad browser compatibility
- Engaging but not overwhelming

#### Choose **3D Tilt** if you want:
- Modern, professional aesthetic
- Good performance across devices
- Card-based design approach
- Subtle but effective interaction

#### Choose **Lighting** if you want:
- Artistic, sophisticated feel
- Unique visual presentation
- Showcase technical skills
- Don't mind longer development time

#### Choose **Parallax Layers** if you want:
- Most immersive experience
- Storytelling through depth
- Showcase complex development skills
- Maximum visual impact

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- **All Effects**: 60fps minimum, GPU acceleration
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Responsive/adaptive behavior
- **Accessibility**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with graceful degradation

### Integration Points
- Replace current particle background system
- Maintain existing content (name, title, CTA)
- Preserve scroll-based navigation
- Keep brand colors and typography

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Prototype (2-3 hours)
1. Create branch from `latest`
2. Build basic effect mechanism
3. Test core interaction

### Phase 2: Enhancement (varies by effect)
1. Add visual polish and animations
2. Implement responsive design
3. Optimize for performance

### Phase 3: Integration (2-3 hours)
1. Integrate with existing components
2. Update styling and layout
3. Test across browsers and devices

### Phase 4: Polish (1-2 hours)
1. Final performance optimization
2. Accessibility compliance
3. Code cleanup and documentation

## Decision Framework

### Quick Start Recommendation
**For fastest implementation**: Start with **3D Tilt Effect**
- Good balance of impact vs complexity
- Proven performance across devices
- Professional aesthetic fit

### Maximum Impact Recommendation  
**For wow factor**: Choose **Parallax Layers Effect**
- Most visually impressive
- Showcases advanced development skills
- Unique portfolio differentiator

### Safe Choice Recommendation
**For reliability**: Go with **Eye-Tracking Effect**
- Moderate complexity, high success rate
- Personal and memorable
- Good browser compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Review each specification** to understand implementation details
2. **Choose primary effect** based on goals and timeline
3. **Create development branch** from selected option
4. **Begin Phase 1 prototype** to validate approach
5. **Iterate and polish** based on results

Each specification includes detailed implementation plans, code examples, performance considerations, and success criteria to guide development.
