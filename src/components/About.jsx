    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I have a diverse educational background with three bachelor's degrees. I
      earned a degree in Finance from UCF in 2013, while simultaneously earning
      a dual bachelor's degree in Business Administration from ICN Business
      School in France, and a degree in Computer Science from Florida
      International University in 2019. Since April 2019, I have been working at
      American Express, where I am currently a Senior Engineer focusing on Full
      Stack development. I continue to grow and apply my skills in software
      development.
