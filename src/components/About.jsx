    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª Born and raised in Venezuela, I'm fully bilingual in English and
      Spanish! But that's just the start of my story. Talk about an overachiever
      - I managed to collect not one, not two, but THREE bachelor's degrees like
      they were Pokemon cards! First, I snagged a Finance degree from UCF in
      2013, while simultaneously (yes, you read that right!) earning a Business
      Administration degree from ICN Business School in France (oui oui! ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·).
      Not content with just that, I went back for the hat-trick and grabbed a
      Computer Science degree from FIU in 2019.

      ðŸ’³ Since April 2019, I've been living the dream at American Express (never
      leave home without it! ðŸ˜‰), where I've worked my way up to Senior
      Engineer. I'm your friendly neighborhood Full Stack developer, constantly
      leveling up my skills like a character in a tech RPG. ðŸŽ® YES, some of this
      is AI generated, and YES it is all true. I am an AI empowered developer,
      and let's be honest, if you are not, then are you really developing?
